        <!--Almost all speakers are driven by voltage‑feedback amps—even though sound is created by <em>current</em> in the-->
        <!--voice coil. Controlling current specially in the midrange dramatically reduces driver distortion --->
        Most modern amplifiers already have extremely low measured distortion; so low that, in a real speaker
        system, <strong>the driver is the distortion bottleneck.</strong>
        <br/>
        The amplifier’s distortion is typically under 0.01%, while the driver’s can be 0.1% to 10%.
        So adding another “zero” to an amplifier spec is often an engineering flex more than a system upgrade.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Here, I’ve been exploring a different lever: make the driver’s current more linear, because current is what creates force in the voice coil.

        That’s what this module does. It uses <strong>Band‑Selective Current Drive (BSCD)</strong>:
        it behaves like a normal low-impedance voltage amp at low frequencies (so resonance stays damped),
        then transitions to <strong>current control</strong> through the rest of the band to clean up distortions (<a href="current-feedback-study">see the study</a>).
        <!--— where driver nonlinearities tend to show up as the kind of distortion that blurs detail.-->

        It also includes a <strong>built‑in DSP</strong> with a simple desktop app for
        easy active crossover and EQ design.

      <h2>Why this matters</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>Midband/HF distortion = fatigue</h3>
        <p>
          Non‑linear distortion blurs vocals and cymbal detail and leads to listening fatigue. A big contributor is
          <strong>current distortion</strong> from inductance modulation in the driver.
        </p>

        <h3>We control what makes sound</h3>
        <p>
          Electrodynamic drivers create sound from voicecoil <em>current</em> (Lorentz force), not voicecoil voltage. By
          improving <strong>current linearity</strong> we improve sound linearity.
        </p>

        <h3>Clarity without pricier drivers</h3>
        <p>
          Reducing nonlinearity with BSCD drops offensive distortions to levels you’d expect from drivers
          <a href="current-feedback-study">6x more expensive.</a> That’s a difference you can hear.

      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>Current control where it matters</h3>
        <p>
          Above the LF region, the module presents <strong>high output impedance</strong> so coil current is less
          sensitive to the driver’s back‑EMF nonlinearity—cleaning up harmonic and intermodulation distortions that
          cloud detail.
        </p>

        <h3>Resonance stays controlled</h3>
        <p>
          Pure current drive removes electrical damping (<em>Q<sub>es</sub></em
          >), lifting total Q. Our <strong>Band‑Selective Current Drive</strong> keeps
          <strong>low output impedance at low frequencies</strong> so the amp behaves like a voltage amp around Fs—your
          woofer remains well‑damped.
        </p>

        <h3>Set once with a simple switch</h3>
        <p>
          Use the <strong>Transition Frequency</strong> switch to place your driver’s Fs inside the low‑impedance region
          (e.g., Low • Mid • High). Choose once during setup—then forget it.

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>Does it work with passive crossovers?</summary>
      <div>
        For current control to be effective, the amplifier should connect directly to the driver. Use the built‑in DSP
        to implement your crossover and EQ actively. However, the amp can be set to operate in voltage drive mode to
        work with a passive crossover.

      <summary>Do I need to be “super technical” to use it?</summary>
      <div>
        The desktop app exposes a friendly UI and simple controls. If you are familiar with EQs and crossovers, you are
        good to go.

    <h2>Curious how/where current drive helps?</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>Technical appendix (optional reading)</summary>
      <div>
        <p>
          An electrodynamic driver’s back‑EMF can be modeled as including a distorting voltage source that is produced
          by modulation of its inductance as a function of current i.e. Le(i) and Le(x). Both distortions tent to be
          dominant at low displacement regimes (e.g. mid and high frequencies) - even at low volumes. <br />By keeping
          <strong>output impedance low at low frequencies</strong>, the amplifier preserves Qes‑linked damping around
          resonance. Above that region it presents <strong>high output impedance</strong> (i.e. transitions into current
          drive), making current less sensitive to the distortion voltages produced by Le(i) and Le(x) thereby reducing
          harmonic and intermodulation distortion products.
